# OOP Project

This school project is my first experience with Java programming, I developed a software using Swing. It's a management software that has the ability to add, modify or delete from a mySQL database.

This project helped solidify my understanding of OOP concepts. Studying just the theory wasn't enough, making this project answered many questions that I had when studying OOP, like "why would I use an abstract class?"

Really enojoyed this experience, learning something new feels good :).
